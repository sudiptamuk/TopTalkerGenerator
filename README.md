 Requirements:
    1. TopTalkerGenerator class must have a way to ingest List<ChatMessage>
    2. TopTalkerGenerator class must have a way to output n top talkers e.g. List<TopTalker>
    3. Please add comments about space and time complexity of the solution above TopTalkerGenerator class
 
  Example:
  Given chat messages from users
  [userA, userA, userA, userB, userC, userC]
  userA messageCount = 3
  userB messageCount = 1
  userC messageCount = 2
  The top two talkers (n = 2) would be [userA, userC]

Test Class which has the main method: TalkerGeneratorTest
Computation Class called from main method: TalkerGenerator
